# Pixels
An example API wrapper for the Python Discord Pixels Event (https://pixels.pythondiscord.com).

This project serves as a refresher for my (non-existent) software design skills in Python, applying
knowledge that I've learnt from reading _Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns (2020)_
by Vladimir Khorikov. I'm also using this project to explore libraries like `attrs` or `loguru` that
I've been putting on hold.

I'd also like to note that the Pixels Event is meant to be a learning opportunity for beginnners for
working with APIs. For this reason, this project will not be published to PyPI and will not
provide further examples or functionality for tasks like drawing actual images on the canvas.
